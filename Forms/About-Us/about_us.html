					<h3>An Israeli fashion designer, established in 2010 at “MALIKA”.</h3>

						Carefully designed fashion items with thought of cuts that will enhance the woman’s body and make you feel the best and most comfortable, using quality fabrics and comfortable and elegant designs.
						
						Production quality is our top priority out of a belief in smart consumerism and the environment; A fashion item designed in a classic cut, made of quality fabric can accompany you for many seasons to come and not just be a temporary item in the closet.
